        The color of the wall enhanced natural light beauty, making the building very tempting and attractive. Considering that we added a center painting, and a hanging chandelier made the room more pleasing giving it a fresh look. Adequately scaled nightlamps made it look great to match the chandelier. 
        According to statistics, if the home is staged, there are 49 percent increases in the dollar value offered.</p>
